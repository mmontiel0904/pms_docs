# Move-Ins and Transfers Overview

After you execute an applicant's lease, the prospect becomes a future resident. When the resident is ready to occupy the unit, you must post a move-in for the resident. You can post move-ins for one or more residents at a time. Once you post a resident's move-in, the resident becomes a current resident.

If a current resident wants to move into a different unit, you can transfer the resident. A transfer copies a resident's information to a new record associated with a new unit.

# Move-In Procedures

This section describes how to move residents into units.  
There are two methods by which you can post move-ins for residents: move-ins and move-in batches. Move-ins are for one resident only. Move-in batches are for multiple residents across properties.

## Assigning Units

![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.05.1.png)

> **Note:** This procedure describes how to perform a task starting from the dashboard. You can perform the task starting from the side menu, but the navigation differs. To follow the procedure exactly, start from the dashboard.

If a future resident's unit is no longer available, or if the resident wants to move into a different unit at the same property, you can assign the resident to a different unit. When you do this, Voyager removes the resident's leasing specials, changes the resident's monthly rent amount to that of the new unit's market-rent amount, and updates the appropriate resident and resident history records.

![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.05.2.png)

> **Note:** Perform this procedure only for future residents. If you want to change a current resident's unit, you must transfer the resident. For more information, see Processing Transfers.

### To assign a future resident to a different unit

1. On the dashboard, click the **Person Search** tab.  
   ![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.05.3.png)
2. Complete the tab, as needed.
3. Click **Search**. A table of matching people appears to the right of the tab.
4. Click the name of the resident that you want to assign to a new unit. The **Resident** screen appears.
5. On the **Functions** menu, click **Assign Unit**. The **Assign Unit** screen appears.

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Adjusting Move-In Dates

![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.06.1.png)

> **Note:** This procedure describes how to perform a task starting from the dashboard. You can perform the task starting from the side menu, but the navigation differs. To follow the procedure exactly, start from the dashboard.

If a resident wants to move into a unit later or earlier than expected, you can adjust the resident's move-in date. When you do this, Voyager changes the resident's move-in date to the new date and updates the appropriate resident and resident history records.

Perform this procedure if you want to record a new move-in date without posting a move-in for the resident. You can perform this procedure only for future residents.

![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.06.2.png)

> **Note:** If you have selected the Insurance Required for Move-in check box, you can adjust the move-in date only if the resident's renters insurance policy is active for this date.

![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.06.3.png)

> **Note:** If your property uses the Lease Ready Process, a warning message appears when you reopen the Move-In screens if move-in dates are adjusted.

### To adjust a future resident's move-in date

1. In the **Resident Activity** section on the dashboard, click the number next to **Move In**.  
   ![Image](images/v_res_usr_move-ins_and_transfers.08.06.4.png)
2. Click the **Adjust Dates** button for the relevant resident.
3. Complete the **Adjust Move-In Dates** screen.
4. Click **Post**.

| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Move-In Date       | New move-in date for the resident.           |
| Lease-From Date    | Updated lease start date.                    |
| Term (# of months) | Number of months in the lease term.          |
| Lease-To Date      | Updated lease expiration date.               |

> **Note:** Start from the dashboard for this procedure.
