## Notices and Move-Outs Overview

Typically, when a resident wants to move out of your property, they notify you that they intend to move out on a specific date after the lease expires. When you receive this notification, you must post a notice for the resident. A notice records a resident’s expected move-out date and enables you to perform move-out procedures for the resident.

If a resident does not notify you, or moves out of the property early or unexpectedly, you can record one of three termination types to differentiate the notice:

- If a resident moves out significantly before the lease expires, you can record an early-termination notice.
- If a resident moves out unexpectedly without notifying you, you can record a skip notice.
- If a resident is being required to move out due to violations, you can record an eviction notice.

On the resident’s move-out date, you post a move-out for the resident and post deposit accounting for the resident. Deposit accounting applies charges and credits to the resident’s deposit and processes either a charge or payable, depending on the final balance.
