# Vendor Refunds

If you receive a refund payment from a vendor, you should record it in Voyager as an **adjustment**:

- **Create a negative payable with the type of Adjustment.**
- **Commit the adjustment.**
- **Use the Make Adjustment function.** For more information, see [Processing Adjustments](/yardi_voyager/ap/Processing_Adjustment.md).
