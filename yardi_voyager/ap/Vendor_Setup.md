## Vendor Overview

Vendors are people and organizations that you pay for goods and services, for example, contractors, landscapers, and home improvement stores. Set up the property management company as a vendor if it receives commissions or other fees.

Before you can make a payment to a vendor, you have to set them up in the database and approve them.

### Paying Non-Vendors

Although you may occasionally pay legal entities, owners, employees, and tenants, do not add them as vendors; Voyager allows you to make payments to non-vendors.

When you enter a payable, you select a payee. The lookup defaults to vendors, but you can select any “person-type” record in the database.

Besides vendors, you can select:

- tenants
- property owners
- prospects
- employees
- roommates
- customers

## Vendor Setup

### To add a vendor

1. Select **Payables > Vendors > Add Vendor**. The **Add Vendor** filter appears.

   > **Note:**  
   > ![](images/vendors.10.03.02.png)  
   > This filter appears only if you have done the setup for countries in your database and if you are logged in as a user. If you are logged in as DBO, it does not appear.

   If **Auto-Code Vendors** is selected in the **Accounts & Options** screen, the **Code** field displays (new) and Voyager generates the code after you complete the vendor record. The **Country** field determines the configuration of the address block (this field appears only for clients with a license for International).

2. Complete the screen and click **Submit**. The **Vendor** screen appears.

The following fields require explanation:

| **Field**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Company** <br/> **Name**      | Voyager uses the **Name** field followed by the **Company** field to form the payee name on payments. <br/><br/>For individuals, enter the first name in the **Name** field and the last name in the **Company** field. For example: **Name** = John, **Company** = Doe. Payee Name = John Doe. <br/><br/>For businesses, the **Name** field is optional. You can enter the entire payee name in the **Company** field, or you can split the payee name between the two fields. <br/><br/>For example, if the vendor’s name is The Ace Company, type **The** in the **Name** field and **Ace Company** in the **Company** field. The vendor name, The Ace Company, will be used on payments. <br/><br/>**NOTE** The Vendor filter searches for the contents of the **Company** field, not the **Name** field. If there is part of the name that you want to use in searches, be sure it is in the **Company** field. For example, if you will use “Ace” in searches, it should be entered in the **Company** field. <br/><br/>**NOTE** If you use Voyager to file 1099s electronically, punctuation should be avoided in the **Company** field. Punctuation can cause data misalignment in 1099 files generated for electronic submission to the IRS. |
| **Dear**                        | Type the text that should appear after the word **Dear** at the beginning of a letter. For example, if your contact is Patricia Smith, you might type **Ms. Smith** in the **Dear** field. If you are unsure of the appropriate courtesy title, you can type the name with no courtesy title (e.g., **Pat Smith**). <br/><br/>The **Dear** field is used in system-generated letters, for example, letters created by the **Correspondence** feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Payment Method**              | Select **Check** or **EFT**. Sets a default for payments to the vendor. (If needed, you can override the default when you create payables.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Tax Info Tab (Global, Region = US or Canada)

![](images/vendors.10.03.07.png)

If you have an International license, and the **Region** is set to US or Canada, the **Tax Info** tab shows both sets of fields — the global fields and the US fields.

This allows you to calculate taxes and designate the vendor for a 1099, or a T5018.
