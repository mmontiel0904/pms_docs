# Credit Card Payables: Overview

## Overview

This article describes a new feature—credit card payables—that allows you to account for transactions paid with a credit card outside of Breeze.

Without credit card payables, there is no easy way to record credit card transactions in Breeze.

For example, you buy $1,200 worth of goods at Home Depot with an American Express card. At the end of the month, you receive a statement from American Express that includes the $1,200 purchase from Home Depot, along with other purchases. You pay that bill in full, using a check or EFT.

In Breeze, it is difficult to record exactly what happened. A payable to the vendor (Home Depot) would not have information about the credit card payment, and a payable to the credit card company (American Express) would not have any information about the vendor.

With the credit card payable feature, there are two payables for each purchase:

- One to the actual vendor, for example, Home Depot. This payable includes the name of the credit card company and uses GL accounts designated for credit card purchases.
- Another to the credit card company, for example, American Express. This payable is generated by the system when you reconcile credit card purchases. If there are multiple payables to the same credit card company, they are consolidated.

## Accounting Summary

1. **You pay a vendor with a credit card (outside of Breeze).**

   - Example: You buy $1,200 worth of paint at Home Depot and pay with your American Express card.

2. **You record the transaction in Breeze by creating a payable to the vendor.**
   - On the payable, select the **Credit Card** checkbox. Instead of selecting a Cash account, select the credit card you are using.

### Accounts Affected:

| Account                 | Debit | Credit |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Expense Account - Paint | 1,200 |        |
| Credit Card AP Account  |       | 1,200  |

A credit card payable hits the Credit Card AP account, not the normal AP account.

When you post the payable, Breeze creates a payment record automatically.

| Account                      | Debit | Credit |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Credit Card AP Account       | 1,200 |        |
| Credit Card Suspense Account |       | 1,200  |

The payment debits the Credit Card AP account, clearing it. Instead of a normal cash account, the payment credits the Credit Card Suspense Account.

3. **You receive the bill from the credit card company (American Express).**
4. **You reconcile the payable in Breeze, creating a new payable to the credit card company.**

| Account                      | Debit | Credit |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Credit Card Suspense Account | 1,200 |        |
| Normal AP Account            |       | 1,200  |

The payable clears the suspense account and credits the normal AP account.

5. **You use the regular payment processing function to pay the credit card company.**

| Account           | Debit | Credit |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Normal AP Account | 1,200 |        |
| Cash Account      |       | 1,200  |

### End Result

After processing the payable to the credit card company, only two accounts have a balance:

| Account                 | Debit | Credit |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Expense Account - Paint | 1,200 |        |
| Cash Account            |       | 1,200  |

The other accounts used in the process—the Credit Card AP Account, the Credit Card Suspense Account, and the normal AP account—net to zero.
